Hey visitor!

 🎓 I'm Sanjay and currently I'm on my final year in Bachelor course  on Information Technology 💻. I love to design pages for the web and obviously a web developer by profession :)
 
 🖥️ I'm currently specializing on building apps with react ⚛️
 
 📚 Apart from that I have alot of interest in books. My favourite one will be the Tuesdays with Morrie.
